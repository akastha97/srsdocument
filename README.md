This project highlights the detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document I created as a part of my final project for Advanced Software Engineering course, during my Master's program. This document was specifically designed for developing the FoodSaver iOS App.

## Document Purpose
This SRS document outlines the detailed requirements for the development of the application named "FoodSaver". This document adheres to the industry standards. It includes detailed description of the requirements, including the functional, non-functional requirements, use cases, system architecture, and more. This document serves as a foundational resource for app design and development, can be customised as needed. 

## SRS Document Overview

### Who's it for? 

This document is useful for different groups of people:

1. Software Development Team: Provides a clear blueprint for the development team, ensuring a good understanding of the project's objectives and functionality.
   
2. Client: The person or organization who wants this app made. They need to see if the development team's plans match what they want.

3. Other Project Stakeholders: Anyone else who cares about or is affected by this app. They might want to know what's happening with it.

### This document can be used by Students, for any student who is doing a similar coursework, or project can use this as a reference for their own project.
  
### What's Inside? 
This document contains: 
1. Project Scope: Why this app was made? How is it different from other existing apps? How is it useful for the app users? 
2. General Description: What is the purpose of the application? Who will be benefited? Under what conditions this app must be operated? What are the available software versions?
3. Specific Requirements: What requirements/ features are there in this application? How does the app flow look like? How the app interacts with the users?
    -  For each requirement, description, actors, triggers, pre & post conditions, and exceptions are specified. 
4. Non Functional Requirements: How is the app performance? How scalable is it? How is it and will be maintained? How reliable, and secure is it? What will the measures taken by the developers in the future to maintain?
5. Design and Development: What is the software process model being followed by the software team? How is it designed?

### Use Case and Class diagrams

1. The use case diagram  is clearly designed to explain the flow of the application between the end users and the application. It shows how does the application interacts between features and end users. Also, how does the app flow from one requirement to the other.
2. The class diagram for the entire application has been designed using an online tool. This class diagram has been designed in iterations, based on the development done till then. Each iteration shows the changes in the models and software patterns used.
